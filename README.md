# SMPDO
SIMAGORA Materials and Product Development Ontology

## Use cases

- The ontology will be used to describe materials and production development (e.g., the lubricant workflow).
- The ontology is supposed to represent formulations (e.g., the formulations used in the lubricant workflow).

## Competency questions

- What is a virtual experiment (VE)?
- What virtual experiments are used in a workflow?
- What is a formulator?
- What is a simulator?
- What is a descriptor?
- What is a formulation?
- What is a computing model (a fomulator uses a computing model to do sth)? What is a machine learning model?
- What computing models can be used by a formulator?
- What formulations can be generated (another word?) by a computing model?
- What are internal parameters of a virtual experiment?
- What are experiment conditions of a virtual experiment?
- What is an internal parameter?
- What is an experiment condition?
- What descriptors can be used by a computing model?
- What descriptors are used to describe a moleculat structure of the molecule?
- What is a component as molecule?
- What is the proportion of the components in a formulation?
